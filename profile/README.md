**_dae_**, means goose, is a high-performance transparent proxy solution.

In order to improve the traffic split performance as much as possible, dae runs the transparent proxy and traffic split suite in the Linux kernel by eBPF. Therefore, dae has the opportunity to make the direct traffic bypass the forwarding by proxy application and achieve true direct traffic through. Under such a magic trick, there is almost no performance loss and additional resource consumption for direct traffic.

## Features

- [x] Implement `Real Direct` traffic split (need ipforward on) to achieve [high performance](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UaWU6nNho7edBNjNqC8dfGXLlW0-cm84MM7sH6Gp7UE/edit?usp=sharing).
- [x] Support to split traffic by process name in local host.
- [x] Support to split traffic by MAC address in LAN.
- [x] Support to split traffic with invert match rules.
- [x] Support to automatically switch nodes according to policy. That is to say, support to automatically test independent TCP/UDP/IPv4/IPv6 latencies, and then use the best nodes for corresponding traffic according to user-defined policy.
- [x] Support advanced DNS resolution process.
- [x] Support full-cone NAT for shadowsocks, trojan(-go) and socks5 (no test).
- [x] Support various trending proxy protocols, seen in [proxy-protocols.md](https://github.com/daeuniverse/dae/blob/main/docs/en/proxy-protocols.md).
